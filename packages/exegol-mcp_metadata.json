While certain elements of the source code, scripts, documentation, or containers may be made publicly accessible, such availability is intended to foster transparency, community trust, and collaboration.\n         \n         This public access does not imply a waiver of Execorp's intellectual property rights, nor does it authorize unrestricted or commercial use of the software.\n         \n         ### License Transition and GPL3 Coexistence\n         \n         Exegol is transitioning from the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPL3) to the Execorp Software License (ESL).

Definitions\n         \n         - **Execorp**: company publishing Exegol\n         - **Exegol**: all software, scripts, Docker images, documentation, and associated content published by Execorp under this name\n         - **User**: any individual or legal entity accessing or using Exegol\n         - **Non-commercial use**: use without direct or indirect purpose of generating revenue or providing third-party services\n         - **Commercial use**: use of Exegol as a tool within a business context for the user's own operations, such as professional activities, internal training, or security operations\n         - **Commercial exploitation**: any activity that uses Exegol as a basis for generating revenue or providing services to third parties, including but not limited to maintenance, support, managed services, repackaging, or reselling\n         - **Subscription**: a monthly or yearly renewed purchase (Pro or Enterprise) that permits commercial use of Exegol under the terms of this license\n         \n         ## 2. Intellectual property\n         \n         Exegol is and remains the exclusive property of Execorp. All rights not expressly granted by this license are reserved.\n         \n         The public availability of part of the source code does not confer any right of use, modification, reproduction, or distribution outside the conditions provided by this license.\n         \n         ## 3. Granted rights\n         \n         ### 3.1 Non-commercial use\n         \n         Execorp grants the user a free, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use Exegol for strictly non-commercial purposes, such as:\n         - Academic research\n         - Individual learning\n         - Participation in cybersecurity competitions (CTF, hackathons)\n         \n         ### 3.2 Commercial Use and Exploitation\n         \n         #### 3.2.1 Allowed Commercial Use (with subscription)\n         With a valid subscription (Pro or Enterprise), you are permitted to use Exegol in a commercial context for your own business operations (e.g., technical assessments, penetration test, bug bounty, research), such as:\n         - Using Exegol as part of your professional activities\n         - Using Exegol in your business or enterprise environment\n         - Using Exegol for internal training or documentation\n         - Using Exegol as part of your security operations\n         \n         #### 3.2.2 Prohibited Commercial Exploitation\n         The following activities are strictly prohibited, even with a valid subscription, as they constitute commercial exploitation of Exegol.
