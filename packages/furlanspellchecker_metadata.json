The\n        following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\n        exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n        \n             Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n             intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n             permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n             copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n             irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n             and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n             Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n             applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n             material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n             material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n             licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n             limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n            wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n        \n             Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n             licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n             licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n             the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n             example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n             copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n             licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n             other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n             the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n             reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n             rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n             such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n             Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n             respect those requests where reasonable.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a\n        contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your\n        acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You\n        such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from\n        making the Licensed Material available under these terms and\n        conditions.\n        \n        Section 1 -- Definitions.\n        \n          a.

For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n             Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n             Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n             synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n        \n          b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n             and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n             accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n        \n          c.

Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n             terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n             all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n             Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n        \n          h.

NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards\n             commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of\n             this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for\n             other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital\n             file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is\n             no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the\n             exchange.\n        \n          j. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n             process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n             as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n             dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n             available to the public including in ways that members of the\n             public may access the material from a place and at a time\n             individually chosen by them.\n        \n          k.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n             under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n        \n        \n        Section 2 -- Scope.\n        \n          a. License grant.\n        \n               1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n                  the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n                  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n                  exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n        \n                    a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n                       in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n        \n                    b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for\n                       NonCommercial purposes only.\n        \n               2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n                  Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n                  License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n                  its terms and conditions.\n        \n               3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n                  6(a).\n        \n               4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n                  Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n                  all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n                  and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n                  Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n                  authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n                  necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n                  technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n                  Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n                  simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n                  (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n        \n               5. Downstream recipients.\n        \n                    a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n                       recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n                       receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n                       Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n                       Public License.\n        \n                    b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n                       any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n                       apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n                       Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n                       Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n                       Material.\n        \n               6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n                  may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n                  are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n                  with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n                  the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n                  provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n        \n          b. Other rights.\n        \n               1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n                  licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n                  privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n                  the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n                  assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n                  extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n                  Rights, but not otherwise.\n        \n               2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n                  Public License.\n        \n               3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n                  collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n                  Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n                  under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n                  licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n                  reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n                  the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n                  purposes.\n        \n        ...
